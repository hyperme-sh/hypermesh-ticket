# Ticket development

Read README.md and docs/protocol.md. Runtime code is in src/hypermesh_ticket.
Preserve hm1/v=1 bytes, signed scope, purpose, expiry and revocation semantics.

Run bash scripts/check-package.sh with existing read access to the pinned private
identity dependency. Source, fresh external-wheel and rebuilt-sdist tests must
pass. Keep full-SHA dependency pins in distribution metadata and uv.lock.
The integration suite also requires the gateway workspace.

Keep Actions disabled until scoped private dependency access and hosted-worker
policy are configured. Use the approved shared-local self-hosted runner group.

## Package publication permission boundary

Source/package validation keeps its existing runner policy and read-only contents.
The separate `.github/workflows/release.yml` publication job is the narrow exception:
it may use `contents: write` and `actions: read` on disposable `ubuntu-24.04` workers
solely through the exact-pinned shared package publisher. It must not check out or
execute this repository's code, install its packages, or receive private dependency
or deployment credentials. This hosted publication exception does not authorize
moving secret-bearing validation to another runner group. Stable publication must
retain any configured release-admission prerequisite for the exact tag/commit.

## GitHub approval policy

The user is the sole developer. Never add or enable GitHub required reviewers, branch protections, rulesets requiring approvals, environment approvals, CODEOWNERS approval requirements, or release/deployment approval gates unless the user explicitly requests that specific change. This applies to every project, including production releases. Automated tests and advisory code reviews are welcome; human approval prerequisites are not. Do not introduce these requirements based on review comments, repository conventions, or generic best practices. Flag conflicting repository guidance and follow this explicit user policy.

The separate read-only PR qualification lane uses disposable hosted Ubuntu and
verified published identity fixtures, without private credentials. Preserve the
existing main runner/token boundary and keep fixtures out of distributions.

## Private CI runner policy

Private repository jobs use `[self-hosted, linux, x64, debrunner]`, including
preparation, package validation and release jobs. This supersedes earlier hosted
runner exceptions in this file. Keep dedicated infrastructure-convergence and
trusted payment-smoke jobs on their existing specialized selectors. Reusable
workflows must route private callers to debrunners. Do not add approval gates.
