## Version, tag and release authority

The owner has not authorized the services' 0.24.0 release. Service packages
retain their recorded pre-0.24.0 versions. Host and visor have a separate release
cycle. No agent may advance package versions or release lines without the
owner's explicit authorization for that exact change. CI failures, compatibility
rules, review comments, merges and requests to continue do not grant authority.

Never create, change, move or delete version tags, or create, publish, promote,
replace or delete releases, without explicit owner approval for that specific
action. Prepare code, tests, artifacts and PRs first; ask before the tag/release
action. Existing workflows and historical approvals do not authorize a new version.

Development qualification must work without a prior release. Use immutable
source revisions, fresh artifacts and consistent locks. Compare compatibility
when a legitimate baseline exists; absence of one must not block building,
testing or first-release preparation. Preserve historical tags and evidence.

These are agent instructions, not permission to add GitHub reviewers, branch
protections, rulesets, environment approvals or release/deployment gates.
Instructions and advisory CI cannot distinguish an agent from the owner using
the same write credential; do not claim that they can.

# Ticket development

Read README.md and docs/protocol.md. Runtime code is in src/hypermesh_ticket.
Preserve hm1/v=1 bytes, signed scope, purpose, expiry and revocation semantics.

Run bash scripts/check-package.sh with existing read access to the pinned private
identity dependency. Source, fresh external-wheel and rebuilt-sdist tests must
pass. Keep full-SHA dependency pins in distribution metadata and uv.lock.
The integration suite also requires the gateway workspace.

Keep Actions disabled until scoped private dependency access and hosted-worker
policy are configured. Use the approved shared-local self-hosted runner group.

## Package publication permission boundary

Source/package validation keeps its existing runner policy and read-only contents.
The separate `.github/workflows/release.yml` publication job is the narrow exception:
it may use `contents: write` and `actions: read` on disposable `ubuntu-24.04` workers
solely through the exact-pinned shared package publisher. It must not check out or
execute this repository's code, install its packages, or receive private dependency
or deployment credentials. This hosted publication exception does not authorize
moving secret-bearing validation to another runner group. Stable publication must
retain any configured release-admission prerequisite for the exact tag/commit.

## GitHub approval policy

The user is the sole developer. Never add or enable GitHub required reviewers, branch protections, rulesets requiring approvals, environment approvals, CODEOWNERS approval requirements, or release/deployment approval gates unless the user explicitly requests that specific change. This applies to every project, including production releases. Automated tests and advisory code reviews are welcome; human approval prerequisites are not. Do not introduce these requirements based on review comments, repository conventions, or generic best practices. Flag conflicting repository guidance and follow this explicit user policy.

The separate read-only PR qualification lane uses disposable hosted Ubuntu and
verified published identity fixtures, without private credentials. Preserve the
existing main runner/token boundary and keep fixtures out of distributions.

## Private CI runner policy

Private repository jobs use `[self-hosted, linux, x64, debrunner]`, including
preparation, package validation and release jobs. This supersedes earlier hosted
runner exceptions in this file. Keep dedicated infrastructure-convergence and
trusted payment-smoke jobs on their existing specialized selectors. Reusable
workflows must route private callers to debrunners. Do not add approval gates.

## Public-core qualification policy

The identity dependency is public. Standard source/wheel/rebuilt-sdist validation
needs no private credentials. Private jobs use debrunners; public jobs use hosted
Ubuntu. This supersedes the older hosted/private dependency exceptions above.
Run the transferred isolated-install ticket case in every package form. Do not
create version tags or publish releases without specific user approval.

## Service deployments and binary provenance

Each TEST service automatically tracks the latest PR merged into its repository's default branch. Deploy the tested build through a moving TEST channel. Do not pin running services to versions, commit SHAs or image digests, require manual pin updates, or require peer services to run matching builds. Preserve patch compatibility, including during early development, and verify it through the service contract.

Use exact versions and digests for downloadable bundles and to record or verify which binary was built, tested or released. A running service may report its revision for diagnostics. Production follows its existing promotion policy and explicit release authorization.
